* **Routing** - The routing system supports the same syntax as Flask.
* **Templating** - The templating system uses jinja2 for the backend.
* **Route Parameters** - The route parameters are passed to the view function as keyword arguments.
* **Template Inheritance** - The templating system supports template inheritance.

Add support for the following features:

* **Session** - The session system is currently not implemented.
* **Request** - The request object is currently not implemented.
